  "question": "How does U-Net achieve precise segmentation with limited training data?",
  "answer": "U-Net uses encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections that preserve spatial information.",
  "explanation": "## Why Asked\nTests understanding of medical image segmentation and data-efficient architectures\n## Key Concepts\n- Contracting path (encoder) captures context\n- Expansive path (decoder) enables localization\n- Skip connections combine low-level and high-level features\n- Symmetric architecture with no padding\n## Code Example\n```\nclass UNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.encoder = Encoder()\n        self.decoder = Decoder()\n        self.skip_connections = []\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Encoder path with skip storage\n        features = self.encoder(x)\n        # Decoder path with skip fusion\n        return self.decoder(features, self.skip_connections)\n```\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How do skip connections prevent information loss?\n- What's the difference between U-Net and FCN?\n- How would you modify U-Net for multi-class segmentation?",
