  "question": "Describe a time when you had to mediate a conflict between two team members with different technical approaches. How did you handle it?",

  "explanation": "## Why Asked\nAssesses conflict resolution skills, technical judgment, and leadership abilities in team dynamics.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Active listening and empathy\n- Technical evaluation frameworks\n- Consensus building techniques\n- Professional communication\n- Decision-making under pressure\n\n## Code Example\n```\nfunction resolveTechnicalConflict(approach1, approach2, requirements) {\n  const evaluation = {\n    performance: comparePerformance(approach1, approach2),\n    maintainability: assessMaintainability(approach1, approach2),\n    timeline: estimateImplementation(approach1, approach2)\n  };\n  \n  return recommendSolution(evaluation, requirements);\n}\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How do you handle when one party refuses to compromise?\n- What metrics do you use to evaluate technical solutions?\n- How do you ensure the decision doesn't harm team morale?",
