  "question": "What's the difference between @State, @Binding, and @Environment in SwiftUI?",
  "answer": "@State owns data locally, @Binding shares data bidirectionally, @Environment provides app-wide values.",
  "explanation": "## Why Asked\nTests understanding of SwiftUI data flow patterns and property wrapper usage in real apps.\n## Key Concepts\n- @State: Local source of truth for view-owned data\n- @Binding: Two-way connection to external state\n- @Environment: System-provided or custom app-wide values\n## Code Example\n```\nstruct ParentView: View {\n    @State private var count = 0\n    @Environment(\\.colorScheme) var colorScheme\n    \n    var body: some View {\n        ChildView(count: $count)\n    }\n}\n\nstruct ChildView: View {\n    @Binding var count: Int\n    \n    var body: some View {\n        Button(\"\\(count)\") { count += 1 }\n    }\n}\n```\n## Follow-up Questions\n- When would you use @StateObject instead?\n- How does @EnvironmentObject differ from @Environment?\n- Can you explain property wrapper composition?",
