  "question": "How do hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and regularization work together to prevent overfitting in machine learning models?",
  "answer": "Hyperparameter tuning finds optimal model settings, cross-validation evaluates model generalization, and regularization adds constraints to prevent overfitting.",
  "explanation": "## Why Asked\nTests understanding of fundamental ML model optimization techniques and how they complement each other in building robust models.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model settings like learning rate, regularization strength\n- Cross-validation: Evaluating model performance on multiple data splits\n- Regularization: Adding penalty terms (L1/L2) to constrain model complexity\n- Overfitting prevention: Balancing model fit with generalization ability\n\n## Code Example\n```\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n# Pipeline with regularization\npipeline = Pipeline([\n    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n    ('ridge', Ridge())\n])\n\n# Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation\nparam_grid = {'ridge__alpha': [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0]}\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5)\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Evaluate with cross-validation\ncv_scores = cross_val_score(grid_search.best_estimator_, X, y, cv=10)\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How do you choose between L1 and L2 regularization?\n- What's the difference between k-fold and stratified cross-validation?\n- How do you handle hyperparameter tuning for deep learning models?\n- When would you use early stopping vs regularization?",
