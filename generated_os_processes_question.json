  "question": "What is the difference between a process and a thread, and how does context switching differ between them?",
  "answer": "Process: separate memory space, heavier context switch. Thread: shared memory, lighter context switch.",
  "explanation": "## Why Asked\nTests fundamental OS knowledge and understanding of system resource management.\n## Key Concepts\n- Process isolation and memory protection\n- Thread synchronization and shared resources\n- Context switch overhead and performance implications\n- CPU scheduling algorithms\n## Code Example\n```\n// Process creation (heavyweight)\npid_t pid = fork();\n\n// Thread creation (lightweight)\npthread_create(&thread, NULL, function, NULL);\n\n// Context switch saves:\n// Process: full memory space, registers, PCB\n// Thread: registers, stack pointer, thread-local data\n```\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How does the OS scheduler handle threads vs processes?\n- What are race conditions and how do you prevent them?\n- When would you choose processes over threads?",
