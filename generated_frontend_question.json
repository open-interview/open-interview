  "question": "What is the difference between DOM manipulation and using the Virtual DOM in modern web frameworks?",
  "answer": "Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation that batches updates for better performance than direct DOM manipulation.",
  "explanation": "## Why Asked\nTests understanding of performance optimization in modern frontend development and how frameworks like React work.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- DOM tree structure and reflow/repaint\n- Virtual DOM as abstraction layer\n- Diffing algorithm and reconciliation\n- Batch updates and performance benefits\n\n## Code Example\n```\n// Direct DOM manipulation (expensive)\ndocument.getElementById('count').textContent = count;\n\n// Virtual DOM approach (React)\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n// React batches updates and diffs changes\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?\n- What are the performance implications of frequent DOM updates?\n- When would you use direct DOM manipulation instead of Virtual DOM?",
