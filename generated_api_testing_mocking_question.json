  "question": "How would you implement API mocking in a React application using MSW (Mock Service Worker) to intercept and mock network requests during development and testing?",
  "answer": "Use MSW to define request handlers with rest.get/post/put/delete, then start the service worker to intercept fetch/XHR requests in browser.",
  "explanation": "## Why Asked\nTests API mocking skills crucial for frontend development, ensuring reliable testing without backend dependencies.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Service Worker API for request interception\n- Request handlers and response mocking\n- Development vs testing environment setup\n- Request/response transformation\n\n## Code Example\n```\n// src/mocks/handlers.js\nimport { rest } from 'msw'\n\nexport const handlers = [\n  rest.get('/api/users', (req, res, ctx) => {\n    return res(\n      ctx.status(200),\n      ctx.json([{ id: 1, name: 'John' }])\n    )\n  })\n]\n\n// src/mocks/browser.js\nimport { setupWorker } from 'msw'\nimport { handlers } from './handlers'\n\nexport const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)\n\n// src/index.js\nimport { worker } from './mocks/browser'\nworker.start()\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How do you handle dynamic responses based on request parameters?\n- What's the difference between MSW and traditional mocking libraries?\n- How would you mock WebSocket connections with MSW?\n- How do you ensure mocks don't leak between tests?",
